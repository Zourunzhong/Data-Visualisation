Tableau Story of the dataset of “Jobs.xlsx” , a compiled set of 160,000+ applications for certification to the US DOL from 2008 to 2015.The applications must include the proposed salary for the foreign worker, and the prevailing salary for a local candidate (this is called the prevailing wage). The DOL checks to ensure equity between foreigners and locals. At the end of this application, the company’s application will be ‘certified’ or ‘denied’ by the DOL. If it is certified, the candidate can proceed to apply for his visa.

Tableau was used to generate visualisations 

Applicants were split up into sucessful applicants ( certified ) and unsucessful applicants (denied ) to further identify the different characteristics influencing such change.
